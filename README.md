## Requirements
* Install Jupyter notebook [redirect to install](https://jupyter.org/install).
* For Windows install GCC / G++ Compiler [MinGW or Cywing](https://www.mingw-w64.org).
* For MacOS you can use prebuild Clang, If you want GCC/G++ you can install it using [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc). 
* (optional) Install LaTex for your OS [get it here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
* (optional) or Use Google Colab [lets go!!](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index).
